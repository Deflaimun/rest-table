        Create a new issue for new features to be documented. Provide as much information as possible. 

        Documentation Issues must be distinct and not overlap. 

        If filing an Issue for a feature that spans platform and cloud, you must file two separate Issues. 

        Each Issue will drive the new content in GitHub for the respective platform or cloud doc. 

        This template is strictly used internally by Redpanda. If a documentation needs additional clarification or you're reporting a bug, consider using Documentation Request.
